        <h2>Best Player in the League</h2>
        <p>
             Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.

            <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
<p>
    Some of my hobbies are playing sports such as football, baseball, and basketball. I also like playing video games and watching television with my cat. I like to go to church and describe to people who jesus christ is and why he died on the cross for our sins.Some of my interests are english bulldogs(insert link to cute photo) because I want one so bad. Another one of my interests are watching baseball games with my family because you only get so much time to hang out with them.

            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>
                    I have 4 siblings but only 2 with the same parents. I have two sister and two brothers. I have a grandfather, grandmother, aunt, uncle, and two cousins. I have about 25 other family members, but I do not know them as much as I know the people I listed.I love all of my family with all of my heart because family is everything. They will help me when I am feeling down, and they will keep me positive when I am. Any way that I decide to go, they will be right there with me, giving me the best advice.
