        <h2>6th Grade Learning</h2>
        <p>
                In 6th grade I learned how to type without looking at my fingers. Also, I learned how to use a word document correctly and use the shortcuts that it gives us. I had ms. mcclure, and she was a good teacher.

            <h4>8th Grade Learning</h4>
            <p>
                In 8th grade I have learned so far how to use html and css, and how to code better. I have also increased my typing by about 10 WPM and I am still increasing. I am on the verge of learning more, and I will increase my knowledge with the best teachers that will help do so.
