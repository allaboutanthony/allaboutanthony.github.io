        <h2>Plan A</h2>
        <p>My very first choice not just to be in the MLB, but I want to be the best in the league that I can be. I want to play on the Houston Astros, or a good team. I want ot win a lot of world series games, and I want to be on the same teams as my friends.

            <h3>Plan B</h3>
<p>If that does not work out, I want to be an elementary school teacher, for 4th or 5th graders. I would want to teach at the elementary school that I attended. I will be an energetic and bright teacher because that is how I learn best, so it must work on other people as well.

            <h4>Plan C</h4>
            <p>
                If that fails as well, I would want to be a cop or a police officer. This is because my friend's dad is a cop and it looks like he is always involved, having new experiences and meeting new people. I also want to be a good influence on kids that look up to me and want to describe why people should do the right thing.
